                <p class="lead">Mahaprasad is cooked only in earthen pots inside the temple kitchen and medium of food is fire wood only. 
                                Mahaprasad can only be eaten on banana leaf while sitting on the floor. In most temples in India, the food that has been offered to the Deities is called as 'Prasad', but only in Lord Jagannath temple the food that has been offered is called 'MahaPrasad'.
                                In Odia language 'Maha' means 'Great', so the word 'MahaPrasad' itself depicts the sagacity of greatness.Dried rice Mahaprasad known as 'Nirmalya' is also used by devotees for different sacred occasions. 
                                Nirmalya is equally important as Mahaprasad. It is also believed by Hindus that at the time of death, the Nirmalya and holy basil (Tulsi) with water is poured in the tongue and throat of the imminent deceased persons with the belief that by taking these items after their death their soul will remain in peace and there will be no 'Jamadanda' (Punishment by death God) of the Belzibup. 
                                Tourists visiting Puri prefer to carry this dry Mahaprasad with them which they can keep at home and consume whenever required.Every day throughout the year millions of devotees from around the world visit Jagannath temple to get the divine blessings of Lord Jagannath, the Lord of the Universe. 
                                It is believed that both Lord Jagannath and the Mahaprasad share an equal status. Sharing the Mahaprasad is considered as a blessing through which devotees get salvation from their sins. Therefore the visit to the Lord Jagannath temple is incomplete without having the Mahaprasad.</p>
